# cc-Portfolio-Project

## Description 
For my codecademy portfolio project I created a personal portfolio with the knowledge I have acquired in throughout the course.  I used Html to structure the web page, and Css to style it.  I added functionality with Javascript by adding a drop down navigation bar in the header.  The file is up loaded properly in github using the proper version control methods.  

## RoadMap 
In the future I plan on adding new and old projects to my site. Along with a contact page with the ability to link to my email.  Lastly, I would like to add a personal social media aspect to my page to give potential employers a good view of who I am as a person.
